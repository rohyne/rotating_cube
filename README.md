a project i did for fun. heavily inspired by this youtube video: https://youtu.be/p09i_hoFdd0?si=mzqpaW4Z2baN7Tm2

i did this mostly to learn about how 3d graphics are processed and a bunch of other linear algebra stuff.
i have left comments in the .c file for my understanding mostly, but i feel like they explain the main functioning of the program pretty well.

leaving this on my github so i can come back to it later, if i do.
