==== HOW TO RUN ===

using a terminal, navigate to the folder the file is in, and run this command

./cube <--- first iteration; roughest of them all

./cubeshade <--- second iteration; added shading

./cubecircle <--- third; added a circle on each face

./companioncube <--- fourth; added a heart in the circles to (somewhat) resemble companion cubes from the Portal games


==== EXTRA ====

a project i did for fun. first program (cube.c) heavily inspired by this youtube video: https://youtu.be/p09i_hoFdd0?si=mzqpaW4Z2baN7Tm2

i did this mostly to learn about how 3d graphics are processed and rendered on screen.
i have left comments in the .c files for my understanding mostly, but i feel like they explain the main functioning of the program pretty well.

leaving this on my github so that i have something on here lmao
